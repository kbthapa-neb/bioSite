It is my privilege to introduce Suresh Thapa, who is my younger brother. During the years that we have grown up together,
 I have observed he is extra ordinary child in his child hood. Since he has grown up, he had proved being school toppers in high
 school graduation. Then he decided to proceed his career being scientist and he graduate his college on Biochemistry. In 2009,
 he decided to start his Master degrees in Dublin, Ireland. He completed his master in 2012 from Trinity College.
        </p>
		        <p>
After complete Master Degree in 2012, he started his career working at few pharmaceutical companies as Scientist Analyst roles.
Currently he is working in Pfizer Company in Dublin and I feel proud with him in matter at least some percentage of contribution
launch Covid Vaccine.

Suresh is a high-minded individual of exceptional character and integrity. I remember he was once asked at an interview,
After accepting a job at a company, would you consider a competitor offer with a higher pay than the new employer offer?
Suresh did not hesitate before answering in the negative. He added that a job is a relationship, and like any relationship,
it thrives when nurtured with honesty and integrity. There are countless such occasions when Suresh has proven to be in a class apart,
in terms of possessing an impeccable character. I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending her.
